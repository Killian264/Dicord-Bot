# Discord-Bot
C# Discord Bot that I am currently working on using .NET and Discord.Net.

------------------------------------------------------

Implemented:
Birthday Module that will read a file and print the next birthday from the list.

Merged Castle's code which simplified TryParse with try and get, add more detailed errors, and simplified some other code. 

Async framework that allows for more modules

Dictionary Module that gives you definition of a word

-----------------------------------------------------

TODO Main:
Add Birthday commands such as append and delete without having to open the file

-----------------------------------------------------

TODO Methods:
Song Player - Plays song from youtube

Image Get - Runs an api on some website and returns images.
