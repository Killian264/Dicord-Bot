# Discord-Bot
C# Discord Bot that I am currently working on using .NET and Discord.Net.

------------------------------------------------------

Implemented:

Birthday Module that will read a file and print the next birthday from the list. Added Birthday All command.

Merged Castle's code which simplified TryParse with try and get, add more detailed errors, and simplified some other code. 

Async framework that allows for more modules

Dictionary Module that gives you definition of a word

Config File - bin/Debug/netcoreapp2.0 - If you change location update filePaths in code.

Reddit Image Get - given a subreddit and the amount of images you would like gets 100 of the top posts for the day and uploads the images to discord.

-----------------------------------------------------

TODO Methods:

Song Player - Plays song from youtube

-----------------------------------------------------

TODO General:

Implement discord privileges into bot features.
